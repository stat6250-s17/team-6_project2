This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding Zillow Rent Index, the median estimated monthly rental 
price for a given area, and covers multifamily, single family, condominium, 
and cooperative homes in Zillowâ€™s database, regardless of whether they are 
currently listed for rent. 
Dataset Name: _analytic_file created in external file

*******************************************************************************;

title1
'Research question: Which metropolitan area is the most expensive to live in?'
;

title2
'Rational: We can have a rough idea of the range of the rent and the tendency of
house renting over the year.'
;

footnote1
"We can see that New York City is the most expensive to live in from the output."
;

footnote2
"We can conclude that Los Angels, San Francisco, Chicago are almost as expensive
as New York to live in."
;

footnote3
"We can see that there are several areas with extreme low rents that behaive like
outliers."
;

*
Note: This compares the column "city" from price.xsl to the column of the
same name from rentprice2016.

Methodology: When combining rentprice2015 with rentprice2016 during data 
preparation, take the difference of values of house renting for eachcity 
and create a new variable called price_rate_change_2015_to_2016. Then,
use proc sort to create a temporary sorted table in descending by
price_rate_change_2015_to_2016. Finally, use proc print here to display the
first five rows of the sorted dataset.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for cities with missing data,
nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, like filtering for percentages
between 0 and 1.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any possible
illegal values, and better handle missing data, e.g., by using a previous year's
data or a rolling average of previous years' data as a proxy.

title1
'Question: Which top 3 area obtain the house rent that increase fastest in the 
past five years and which areas increase the slowest?'
;

title2
'Rational: We can then analysis the tendency of the house renting and know the 
relationship between the location and house rent price over the years, also get 
the overall graph of the rent.'
;

footnote1
"The house renting of Los Angels, New York and Chicago increase the fastest and
the house renting of Wichita, Aurora, Laredo increase the lowest. "
;

footnote2
"We can see that there are bunch of areas keeps increase in a gentle tendency."
;

footnote3
"There are some missing values that needed to be clean out."
;

Note: This compares the column "city" from rentprice2015
to the column city from rentprice2016. 

Methodology: Use proc means to compute 5-number summaries of house rent for
2015 and 2016. Then use proc format to create formatsthat bin both columns with 
respect to the proc means output. Then use proc freq to create a cross-tab 
of the two variables with respect to the created formats.

Limitations: Even though predictive modeling is specified in the research
questions, this methodology solely relies on a crude descriptive technique
by looking at correlations along quartile values, which could be too coarse a
method to find actual association between the variables.

Followup Steps: A possible follow-up to this approach could use an inferential
statistical technique like linear regression.

*******************************************************************************;

title1
'Question: During which months or seasons do the house renting decrease overall 
according to the output?'
;

title2
'Rational: We can study the relationship between the location and the lowest rent 
over the year and observe the reason behind this changed/unchanged variables.'
;

footnote1
"Generally speaking, we can see that February, September and Novemember have the 
lowest house renting compared to the other months."
;

footnote2
"We can conclude that the months with most expensive house renting is August, 
January and July."

footnote3
"There are some missing values in the xls, we need to clean out and run the code 
more precisely."

Note: This compares the column for each month from rentprice15 to the column TOTAL
from rentprice16.

Methodology: When combining rentprice15 and rentpricef16 during data preparation, 
take the difference between house rent for each month in 2015 and TOTAL in 2016 for
each city and create a new variable called rentprice_rate_change. Then, use proc 
sort to create a temporary sorted table in descending by rentprice_rate_change. 
Finally, use proc print here to display the first 12 rows of the sorted dataset.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for each months' rents with missing 
data, nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, like filtering for values
outside of admissable values.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean the values of variables so that the
statistics computed do not include any possible illegal values, and better
handle missing data, e.g., by using a previous year's data or a rolling average
of previous years' data as a proxy.
