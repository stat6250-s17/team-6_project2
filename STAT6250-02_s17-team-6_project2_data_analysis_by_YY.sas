This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding Zillow Rent Index, the median estimated monthly rental 
price for a given area, and covers multifamily, single family, condominium, 
and cooperative homes in Zillowâ€™s database, regardless of whether they are 
currently listed for rent. 

Dataset Name: rentprice_analytic_file created in external file
STAT6250-02_s17-team-6_project2_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file

title1
'Research Question: What are the top ten the highest rent price of cities?' 
;

title2
'Rationale: This should help identify the highest rent price of cities. The rent price is the first thing that anyone who moves here will think about, because the rent would be the largest proportion of people's cost.'
;

footnote1
"Based on the above output, there are top ten highest rent price of cities that are Lausanne, Zurich, Geneva, Basel, Perth, Nashville, Canberra, Bergen, Luxembourg, Stavanger.'
;

footnote2
"Moreover, we can see that the top four highest rent price of cities are Swiss cities."
;

*
Note: This would involve average rent of cites, and then we can 
make a table to see the relationship.

Methodology: Use PROC SORT extract and sort the Average Rent from the dataset,
and output the results to a temporary dataset. Use PROC PRINT to print
the first ten observations from the temporary dataset.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for districts with unknown
data, nor does it attempt to validate data in any way.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean the values of the variable.

title1
'Research Question: Compare the cost of living in Beijing and San Francisco, which one is lower?'
;

title2
'Rationale: Beijing is my hometown city, but now I am living in San Francisco Bay Area for study. I want to know how much of living cost to pay in both of cities, and which one is lower.'
;

footnote1
"As can be seen, there are the cost of living in Beijing and San Francisco."
;

footnote2
"the cost of living in San Francisco is higher than Beijing."
;

*
Note: This would involve making either a frequency chart to show 
the living cost in San Francisco.

Methodology:Compute five-number summaries by Cappuccino, Cinema, Wine, 
Gasoline, Avg Rent and Avg Disposable Income from the dataset, 
and output the results to a temporary dataset. Use PROC PRINT to print
the Beijing and San Francesco observations from the temporary dataset.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for schools with missing data,
nor does it attempt to validate data in any way.

Possible Follow-up Steps: More carefully clean the values of the variable.
