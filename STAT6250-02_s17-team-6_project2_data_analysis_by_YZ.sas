This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding Zillow Rent Index, the median estimated monthly rental 
price for a given area, and covers multifamily, single family, condominium, 
and cooperative homes in Zillowâ€™s database, regardless of whether they are 
currently listed for rent.

"We can see that New York City is the most expensive to live in from the output."
;

footnote2
"We can conclude that Los Angels, San Francisco, Chicago are almost as expensive
as New York to live in."

outliers."
